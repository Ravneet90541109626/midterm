      <h1>Life of a Starfish</h1>
       <p>
         <img src="image/starfish.jpg" alt="loneStarfish">A starfish seems to be a simple being with a center disk and several limbs spreading outside. The number of these arms differs based on the species, and they are covered in small tube feet that let the animal move, feed, and feel its surroundings. The starfish is capable of moving and reacting to its environments due to the unique network of nerves as well as muscles found in each arm. Their strong arms and tube feet can be used to break apart shells, particularly those of clams and mussels. The starfish splits up its shell and pushes its stomach into its prey, where it physically digests it. These fascinating creatures are attractive because they come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and vibrant colors. Starfish have an amazing range of shapes, from little species with beautiful patterns to big ones with spiky bodies. As feeders that are Mollusks, crustaceans, and other tiny underwater creatures make up nearly all of the diet of starfish. They have a special way to eat that entails utilizing their tube feet to break apart their food's shells and moving their stomachs to digest what they eat externally. They are able to consume animals that they are unable to obtain. The number of these arms differs based on the species, and they are covered in small tube feet that let the animal move,
        feed, and feel its surroundings.
